    <h1>PWP Milestone 1</h1>
    <div><h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>My PWP will be a portfolio site to supplement my resume and attract potential clients/employers. It will replace the current GitHub Sites version of my portfolio, and will probably incorporate my Java projects as well.</p>
        <p>As a stretch goal or post-bootcamp project, it may also link to a functioning interface for my personal project from Deep Dive Java.</p>
    </div>
    <div><h2>Audience</h2>
        <!--        Who will be using or viewing your site? Who is this site designed for, and who is your audience comprised of? Could it be for your professional peers and other developers, potential employers, customers, or clients, etc.?-->
        <p>The target audience for my website is recruiters, hiring managers, and clients.</p>
    </div>
    <div><h2>Goals</h2>
        <!--This is should be a quantifiable goal if possible. For example, a goal for your PWP could be:
            To acquire full or part-time employment or an internship.
            To increase sales and/or conversion rates for an existing business.
            To attract freelance clients.
            To serve as a gallery to showcase and promote your work.
            To increase the reach of a new or established social media presence (as measured via analytics tools).-->
        <ul>
            <li>To showcase my programming work and self-advertise.</li>
            <li>To acquire full-time or freelance employment.</li>
        </ul>
