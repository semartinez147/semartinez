    <h1>PWP Milestone 1</h1>
    <div id="writeup">
        <div><h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>My PWP will be a portfolio site to supplement my resume and attract potential clients/employers. It will
                replace the current GitHub Sites version of my portfolio, and will probably incorporate my Java projects
                as well.</p>
            <p>As a stretch goal or post-bootcamp project, it may also link to a functioning interface for my personal
                project from Deep Dive Java.</p>
        </div>
        <div><h2>Audience</h2>

            <p>The target audience for my website is recruiters, hiring managers, and clients like startup founders or side-hustlers.</p>
        </div>
        <div><h2>Goals</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>To showcase my programming work and self-advertise.</li>
                <li>To acquire full-time or freelance employment.</li>
                <li>Create a point of contact separate from social media networks that potential clients can use to start an email conversation with me.</li>
