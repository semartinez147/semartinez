		<h2>Back-end portfolio</h2>
		<p><!--TODO-->I need to research what a Java portfolio should look like. My current concept is a grid of
			Bootstrap cards with a thumbnail and/or brief description, which expand on click to show relevant
			details.</p>
		<p>I think I'll either need to build a few more projects, or pick specific *useful* elements to highlight. This
			section may work better as a carousel showing code snippets.</p>

			<h3>Deep Dive Coding</h3>
			<p><!--TODO-->This needs to be updated with Fullstack info.</p>
			<p>I started learning Java in January 2020. I was confident that I would at least enjoy coding - it
				puts
				a
				lot of the interests that drive my hobbies to work together - but I was surprised to find how
				engrossing
				the process is for me. I picked the basics up very quickly, pushed myself with exercises on
				CodingBat,
				and within a few weeks I was helping my classmates when our instructors were busy. I organized
				weekly
				study sessions at the CNM library and created a collaborative learning community to support all
				of
				us.</p>

			<p>Thanks to Deep Dive, I am proficient with IntelliJ IDE and Java SE 8+. I have experience with
				JUnit4
				testing (and I’m learning JUnit5 on my own), relational database design using MySQL queries,
				RESTful
				services, Android ViewModel architecture incorporating ReactiveX tasks, and more, which you can
				examine
				below. I am also familiar with Scrum and Agile development methods.</p>

			<p>COVID-19 gave me a crash course in remote work. I led my team in daily check-ins and planning
				calls,
				and
				managed our workflow by creating an Asana project to organize ideas and assign tasks. Without my
				instructors in the next room to answer questions, I did a lot of independent research to fix
				bugs
				and
				work out implementations.</p>

		<div class="container">
			<h3>Verizon Wireless</h3>
			<p>I worked at a Verizon Wireless call center from 2010 to 2018. The majority of my experience is in
				tech
				support; the Albuquerque center was among the first to support complex services like
				international
				roaming, home/mobile internet devices, and network extenders (micro cell towers that connect to
				the
				Verizon network through a wired internet connection) on top of all the changes in cell phone
				technology
				over the last decade, and I made sure to familiarize myself with each new set of procedures,
				challenges
				and work-arounds as fast as possible.</p>

			<p>I got my A+ certification to move up in Tech Support, and my Network+ because I was fascinated
				and
				Verizon was covering the cost. I prided myself on the ability to guide even the least-confident
				and
				most
				tech-phobic customers through their router admin screens to configure DHCP reservations, port
				forwarding, occasionally even QoS and DMZ settings for network extenders - without being able to
				see
				their screen . Through these experiences, I became highly skilled at applying research,
				documentation
				and critical thinking to problems. I also perfected the ability to communicate between
				laypersons
				and
				technical experts.</p>

			<p>In my last four years at Verizon I went through leadership training and worked towards a
				Supervisor
				or
				Trainer position. I supplemented my training by using Verizon’s tuition assistance program to
				earn a
				Master’s in Adult Education, with an emphasis in professional learning and development. I
				discovered
				a
				surprisingly deep overlap between the subjects of learning and leading, which helped me motivate
				my
				teams to work harder and smarter, taking pride and initiative in their personal and professional
				growth.
				The ADDIE training model* guided me in creating and iteratively improving learner-focused
				training
				modules for everything from resolving usage disputes to building trust.</p>
